## Gremlins

#### No bug left uncovered. One-click, no-setup QA.

### Problem

Website QA is expensive. Fast moving teams with dynamic products want assurance
that they haven't broken critical functionality, but automated QA is limited and
brittle and manual QA is expensive.

### Solution

Gremlins is a one-click, no-setup QA solution. It uses AI to intelligently
navigate any site or app: filling forms, following flows, and engaging with
the entire site experience automatically, reporting any user errors,
inconsistencies, or visual defects as it goes.

### Target market

Small/medium SaaS companies who are not big enough to support a full-time QA
team and want to iterate quickly without breaking things.

### Business model

Subscription pricing tiered by frequency of scans, size of site, and/or
comprehensiveness of scan.

### Why Gitcorp?

Gitcorp is scratching its own itch: we aspire to automate as much of our own
business processes as possible; Gremlins is a tool that will help Gitcorp
achieve that goal. Additionally, Gitcorp has brand awareness in the target
market.

### Existing solutions

- Manual QA
- Automated browser testing: Selenium, Nightmare, Puppeteer, etc.
