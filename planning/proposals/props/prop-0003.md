## BitKarma

#### Bitcoin donation button and embed

### Problem

Open source projects, artists, and other creators are always looking for new
ways to support themselves, but the old and tired Paypal donate button doesn't
always generate much attention or funds.

### Solution

The BitKarma Bitcoin donation button:

A simple embed for any project, app, or organization to instantly and securely
accept Bitcoin donations. The end-user sees a send address and gets fast,
visible confirmation inside the same site or app that their donation has gone
through and they are now a proud supporter, providing instant gratification and
reinforcing the donation behavior.

### Target market

Open source projects.

### Business model

Take a 1% transaction fee off of every donation.

### Why Gitcorp?

A small, easily deliverable project that seems like a great first product for
Gitcorp to get its feet wet with. Also, it's a project Gitcorp itself could use!

### Existing solutions

- Paypal donate button
- Patreon
